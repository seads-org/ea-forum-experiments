        <h3>1. <a href="tag_report.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analysis of tags</a></h3>
          <p>We analysed various statistics over the tags and showed their pairwise correlations.</p>
          <div><strong>Results:</strong> 40% of tags have less than 10 posts, and most posts have no more than 3 tags. So, the signal is to weak to estimate proper correlations, but some tags can still be groupped.</div>
          <div><strong>Suggestion:</strong> (i) automated tagging would help with missing tags, or (ii) building hierarchies of tags would help users to search posts over broader categories.</div>

        <h3 class="pt-3">2. <a href="user_report.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analysis of users</a></h3>
        <p>We analysed user posting and commenting patterns.</p>
        <div>
          <strong>Results:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Most users (18k) didn't write a single post nor comment</li>
            <li>Recent users are currently more active on the forum than users registered >1 year ago</li>
            <li>People who regularly post on the forum usually have higher rating per post than those who are not active</li>
            <li>Analysing user writing patterns we can see some clear groups of tags corresponding to the user clusters</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="pt-3">3. <a href="ea-forum-docvis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interactive exploration of semantic clusters</a></h3>
        <p>We groupped posts based on their semantic similarity and showed a two-level hierarchy of post topics.</p>
        <div>
          <strong>Results:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>The post clusters provide unbiased visualization of the forum content purely based on post texts.</li>
            <li>The hierarchies can be used as a way to organize the forum in unsupervise manner.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="pt-3">4. <a href="cluster_report.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analysis of semantic clusters</a></h3>
        <p>We matched semantic clusters defined on the previous step with the forum tags and analysed user behavior based on the defined clusters.</p>
        <div>
          <strong>Results:</strong> using semantic clusters provides clearer separation of the users and tags into categories
